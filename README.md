About the Simple Budget Application
I developed this project using the following:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Bootstrap v5
Font-Awesome
This Simple Simple Budget Application allows the user to manage his/her budget and expenses. He/She can update his/her wallet amount that serves as the main budget. Users can also add, list, edit, and delete expenses. The system requires the user to enter an expense name and amount in order to save the expense data. The Add and Edit Expense forms are displayed using the bootstrap Modal which popups or is shown when the designated buttons are triggered or clicked. The system displays a summary of the user budget, expenses, and balance that is shown at the center panel of the screen. The system has a confirmation feature for deleting expense data to prevent the unintentional deletion of data.

Here, you can learn how to manipulate DOM in JavaScript and you will have knowledge on how to manage array or JSON data in javascript and store or manage it using the web browser's local storage. The application user interface was developed with the bootstrap v5 framework.
